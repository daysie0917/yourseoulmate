<p>The outside is modern and simple. It looks like a brunch cafe in nottinghill. There are one 6 seating table and a couple of 2, 4 seating tables. The inside has cozy atmosphere because of wood furnitures and bright sunlight. You should prepay on the counter and use water, dishes, napkins, wet tissue on yourself.</p>

<p>The ricotta tomato green sandwich is a kind of open sandwich that ricotta cheese, cherry tomato pickled in honey, pesto, wild arugula and prosciutto are put on rye bread. It tastes so healthy and good. Each ingredients of the sandwich give off their own flavor and is harmonized well. And the shakshuka is a kind of tomato soup that consists of tomato sauce, eggs and cheese. It is very delicious and substantial meal if you dip slices of rye bread in shakshuka. you can add some slices of rye bread if you pay for only 2 dollars. The shakshuka has dishes for 1 person and for 2-3 persons. The dish for 1 person is not enough for 2 persons but I recommand ordering it to taste several menus. The shakshuka goes well with fresh open sandwich so that I recommand eating shakshuka with open sandwiches.</p>
