<p>Are you planning to tour Seoul? I know youâ€™re going to visit Gyeongbokgung, Seoul N-tower, Insa-dong. Donâ€™t you want your travelling to become a special one? Donâ€™t you want to experience the unique things that your friends havenâ€™t experienced? If you do, I can provide you the new type of tour, â€˜Being a localâ€™! It is not visiting tourist spots in the checklist that all people touring Seoul visit but being a locaI during a trip. For example, Drinking coffee and reading a book in the cool coffee shop, Running along the Han-river and seeing the night view, Trying to go to the Seoulâ€™s rising hipster hot place. I believe it is the best type of tour to enjoy Seoul with our five senses.</p>

<p>â€˜Your Seoulmateâ€™ contains the awesome local places and experiences in Seoul that you cannot search from anywhere. Thatâ€™s because I explored to the places and found out hidden spots for myself. Even the town youâ€™ve heard of, Iâ€™ll show completely different places and experiences in the town that are more of a daily life of authentic locals. For example, A view point that is not yet well-known by tourists but is also fantastic in Samchung-dong. You can get information categorized by shopping, having fun, munching and chilling in Seoul so that you can make your special trip by being a local!</p>

<p>Hello! My name is Suhyun! Iâ€™m a native Soeulite. On traveling, I like to travel without a plan. I like to ask a local local places and enjoy roaming the places slowly. When I traveled to Jeju-island, I asked the guest house host â€˜A beach where there is no one but fantasticâ€™. The beach was totally deserted but more beautiful than other beaches that are famous in the Instagram. Also, He let me know the local restaurant where there is not a signboard, market the locals go every day. It is the best trip i have traveled ever and remain in my memory as travelling not for tourist destinations but only for me. I hope you feel the awesome feeling I had on that day in Jeju. I will be your seoulmate!</p>
