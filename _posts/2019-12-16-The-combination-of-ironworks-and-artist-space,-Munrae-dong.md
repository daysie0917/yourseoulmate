### The hottest neighborhood in Seoul, Munrae-dong

Munrae-dong is one of the hottest neighborhood in Seoul for young local. Munrae-dong was a representative metal industry in Seoul. But over time, the ironworks went out of business and people stopped coming to the area. The government started Munrae-art-factory for support for young artists, and the artists started their workrooms in empty places in the area. The area became called ‘Munrae Creative village’. As remaining ironworks and artist village harmonize together, Munrae-dong has quaint atmosphere. Many young people are charmed by the atmosphere where there is the juxtapoisition of old and new, past and present. I also periodically visit Munrae-dong. At the last part of posting, I’ll let you know my favorite place in Munrae-dong.

At every alley, There are some restaurants, coffee shops, bars which have lots of characteristics. The combination of the dynamic ironworks and the characteristic places makes the area full of unique flavors.

Some artists whose workspace is in Munrae painted a mural so that the normal buildings became individual ones.

***Tips***  &nbsp; Munrae-dong is close to Hongdae (it takes 20 minutes by car), so you'd better go to both areas a day. For example, you can spend your leisure time in Munrae-dong by day and have a exciting time at clubs in Hongdae by night.

***Way to go*** &nbsp; 2 minutes walk from Exit 7 of Munrae Station (Subway line 2)

### My fave place - Yankeetongdak & Second Floor


 If you taste the new local dish you’ve not heard of, you should go to Yankeetongdak!  The signiture menu is ‘Spinach chicken’, which works well with spinach or chicken. With beer, it is really really fantastic! (There are red/white/sparkling wine, single molt whisky, draft beer.) I thought eating chicken, common food, with spinach is so unique. And the restaurant is a three-story building where an old house is remodeled. The restaurant has a interior with old wooden furniture and trendy props and lighting so that the atmosphere is nice and instagramable. The pictures were taken on the open-air terrace when I visit last summer. I enjoyed feeling a cool breeze and looking down the unique street of Munrae-dong. It was such a wonderful time. I hope you experience new local dishes and new local cultures!
