Munrae-dong is one of the hottest neighborhood in Seoul for young local. Munrae-dong was a representative metal industry in Seoul. But over time, the ironworks went out of business and people stopped coming to the area. The government started Munrae-art-factory for support for young artists and the artists started their workrooms in empty places in the area. The area became called ‘Munrae Creative village’. As remaining ironworks and artist village harmonize together, Munrae-dong has quaint atmosphere. Many young people are charmed by the atmosphere where there is the juxtapoisition of old and new, past and present. I also periodically visit Munrae-dong. At the last part of posting, I’ll let you know my favorite place in Munrae-dong.

### Yankeetongdak & Second Floor

If you eat unique chicken you’ve never tasted, Go to ‘Yankeetongdak’! The signiture menu is ‘Spinach chicken’, which works well with spinach or chicken. With beer, it is really really fantastic! I thought eating chicken, common food, with spanich is so unique and quirky. And this restaurant has a interior with old wooden furniture and trendy props and lighting. So that the interior is nice and instagramable. The picture was taken on the open-air terrace when I visit last summer. I enjoyed feeling a cool breeze and looking down the unique street of Munrae-dong. If you taste the new local dish you’ve not heard of, you should go ‘Yankeetongdak’!
