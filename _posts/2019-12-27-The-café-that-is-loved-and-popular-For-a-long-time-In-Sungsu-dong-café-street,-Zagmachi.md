Sungsu-dong café street has been the hot place in Seoul 5 years ago. Sungsu-dong café street was industrial park before. Due to influx of young artists to the area, Many unique cafes and bars came up and the area was rejuvenated. For 5 years, Many places that have various concept opened a business and went out of business because of increasing rents. Even though this situation is repeated, There is a café which keeps its place. It is the café, ‘Zagmachi’! Zagmachi started business when Sungsu-dong café street was up and Zagmachi is converted printing works. Zagmachi has been loved by a lot of local people. The reason, I think, is that Zagmachi sell the special cake that you cannot taste anywhere and the cake and coffee is so tasty. Secondly, The café attracts customers that have various needs including the customers who want to talk with their friends in a cozy places and the customers who want to work using their laptop. So when I went to Sungsu-dong café street, even though there are many cool cafes, I often go to the Zagmachi.

The outside of the Zagmachi is so simple. The inside is quite big and there is a couple of big tables and lots of small table. The vintage props and furnitures make the atmosphere cozy and warm. And a movie was projected on one side of the wall so that interior is nice and instagramable.

On one side, Many Magazine B that choose one brand and introduce the brand are put on the bookself. (Magazine B is famous to local hipster.) Zagmachi is also posted in ‘Magazine B : Seoul’.

There are 4 kinds of cakes : rich chocolate cake, earlgrey chiffon cake, jeju carrot cake, lemon layer cake. And there are coffee and tea and juice. Lemon layer cake is the signature cake in Zagmachi. The lemon layer cake has the best mix of sour flavor of lemon and sweet flavor of cream. Also, Ice Americano I ordered has good balance of sour taste and nutty taste. I hope you eat the cake with americano. it is really really nice!
