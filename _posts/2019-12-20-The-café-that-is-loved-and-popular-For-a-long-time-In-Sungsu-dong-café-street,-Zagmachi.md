Sungsu-dong café street has been the hot place in Seoul 5 years ago. Sungsu-dong café street was industrial park before. Due to influx of young artists to the area, Many unique cafes and bars came up and the area was rejuvenated. For 5 years, Many places that have various concept opened a business and went out of business because of increasing rents. Even though this situation is repeated, There is a café which keeps its place. It is the café, ‘Zagmachi’! Zagmachi start business when Sungsu-dong café street was up and is loved by a lot of local people. The reason, I think, is that Zagmachi sell the special cake that you cannot taste anywhere and the cake and coffee is so delicious. Secondly, The café attracts customers that have various needs including the customers who want to talk with their friends in a cozy places and the customers who want to work using their laptop. So when I went to Sungsu-dong café street, even though there are many cool cafes, I often go to the Zagmachi.

The outside of the Zagmachi is so simple. The inside is quite big and there is a couple of big tables. The vintage props and furnitures make the atmosphere cozy and warm. And a movie was projected on one side of the wall so that interior is nice and instagramable.
